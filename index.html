        I study platform markets, celebrity endorsements, cause-related marketing, and consumer behavior in digital environments. My work spans marketing strategy, advertising, and crowdfunding, with articles appearing in premier journals such as <strong><em>Journal of Marketing</em></strong>, <strong><em>Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science</em></strong>, <strong><em>Psychology & Marketing</em></strong>, and <strong><em>International Journal of Advertising</em></strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I collaborate with scholars at institutions such as New York University, Texas Christian University, and the University of Texas at San Antonio. My dissertation "Two Essays on Value Creation in Platform Market" examined platform exploitation and service agent defection, with subsequent work published in the <em>Journal of Marketing</em>.

      <h3>Research</h3>
      <p>
        My research focuses on value creation in platform markets, celebrity endorsements, cause-related marketing, and consumer psychology. I examine how service agents defect with customers from online platforms (e.g., <em>Journal of Marketing</em>), how psychological ownership and anthropomorphism affect product judgments (<em>Psychology & Marketing</em>), and how direct-speech appeals influence donation behavior in charity crowdfunding (<em>Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science</em>). I have also published reviews and agenda-setting work on celebrity endorsements and cause-related marketing in leading advertising and marketing communications outlets.
